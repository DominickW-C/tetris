tetris game I made in between freshman and sophmore year. I'm pretty proud of this project it is the first
"big project" I've taken on.

A few things I've learned from this project:

    - bug fixing, there was a lot more bugs that I had to fix compared to any other project I have done
    - modular javascript programming
    - collision detection, the collision detection in this game is a lot momre complicated than that in pong
