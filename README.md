tetris game I made in between freshman and sophmore year. I'm pretty proud of this project it is the first
"big project" I've taken on.

A few things I've learned from this project:

    - bug fixing, there was a lot more bugs that I had to fix compared to any other project I have done
        - moving pieces down was a pain
    - modular javascript programming
    - collision detection, the collision detection in this game is a lot momre complicated than that in pong

one of the things I really like about this project is how I made the objects for blocks. it was very organized and making each block seperate made clearing lines and creating shapes super easy.

CURRENTLY NOT FINISHED, CHECK TO DO FOR CURRENT KNOWN BUGS AND WHAT FEATURES I NEED TO DO NEXT
