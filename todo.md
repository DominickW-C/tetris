CURRENT BUGS:

    - tspins messes things up and will clip through blocks
    - can rotate pieces through other pieces
    - clearing blocks is very messed up
    - POSSIBILITY THAT PIECES STICK TO WALL, COULD BE ISSUE WITH PIECES CLEARING THOUGH

save the rotated cords, comapare and if there are overlapping cords then dont rotate
might cause an issue  since whe you draw a block there are overlapping cords

test to see how branching works
