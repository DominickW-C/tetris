CURRENT BUGS:

    - tspins messes things up and will clip through blocks
    - can rotate pieces through other pieces
    - holding a piece and the moving it too soon will cause the game to crash (maybe because a function gets called without enough parameters)

save the rotated cords, comapare and if there are overlapping cords then dont rotate
might cause an issue since whe you draw a block there are overlapping cords
