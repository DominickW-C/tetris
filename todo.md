CURRENT BUGS:

    - tspins messes things up and will clip through blocks
    - can rotate pieces through other pieces
    - clearing blocks is very messed up

save the rotated cords, comapare and if there are overlapping cords then dont rotate
might cause an issue  since whe you draw a block there are overlapping cords
